* Using ResizeObserver instead of MutationObserver
* Delay property is deprecated - component is relying on modal & overlay transition durations instead
* Using transition states to coordinate modal & overlay transitions (previously if overlay transition was longer than
modal transition weird stuff was happening)
* Renamed Event.stop => Event.cancel
* Overlay is not a parent of the modal anymore
* Removed `v--modal-background-click` element
