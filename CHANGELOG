v 2.0.0

* Using ResizeObserver instead of MutationObserver
* Delay property is deprecated - component is relying on modal & overlay transition durations instead
* Using transition states to coordinate modal & overlay transitions (previously if overlay transition was longer than
modal transition weird stuff was happening)
* Renamed Event.stop => Event.cancel
* Overlay is not a parent of the modal anymore
* Removed `v--modal-background-click` element
* Fixed dialogs not working when componentName is changed
* Started using prettier
* Added naive implementation of focus trap
* Building source-maps
* ActiveElement is blurred after before-open is fired - not it is possible to cache document.activeElement
* Setting "classes" prop does not remove .v--modal
