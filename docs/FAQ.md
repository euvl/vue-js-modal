## IE support

This plugin uses arrow functions, resize observer and other modern features.

To be able to use this plugin in IE you need to make sure you transpile the code properly. Please read this [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56446904/transpiling-es6-for-ie11-with-babel).
