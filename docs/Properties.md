# Properties

## Properties

`name: String` **required**

Name of the modal, it is required property.

---

`resizable: Boolean` 

Enables resizing of the modal.

---

---

`draggable: Boolean | String`

Allows dragging the modal within the boundaries of the screen.

Draggable property can accept String parameters. With String value, you can specify a CSS selector to **an element which will be used as a "handler" for dragging**.

  <div class="window-header">DRAG ME HERE</div>
  <div>
     Example
  </div>
</modal>
```

`focusTrap: Boolean`

Enables focus trap meaning that only inputs/buttons that are withing the modal window can be focused by pressing Tab (plugin uses very naive implementation of the focus trap)

---

`reset: Boolean`

Resets position and size before showing

---

`clickToClose: Boolean`  `default: true`

If set to `false`, it will not be possible to close modal by clicking on the background or by pressing Esc key.

---

`transition: String`

CSS transition applied to the modal window.

---

`overlayTransition: String`

CSS transition applied to the overlay (background).

---

`classes: String | Array`

List of class that will be applied to the modal window (not overlay, just the box).

---

`styles: String | Array | Object` 

Style that will be applied to the modal window.


::: warning
To be able to support string definition of styles there are some hacks in place. 

Vue.js does not allow merging string css definition with an object/array style definition. There are very few cases where you might need to use this property, but if you do - write tests :)

---

`width: String | Number` `default: 600`     

Width in pixels or percents (50, "50px", "50%").

Supported string values are `<number>%` and `<number>px`

::: warning
This is not CSS size value, it does not support `em`, `pem`, etc. Plugin requires pixels to recalculate position and size for draggable, resaziable modal. 
If you need to use more value types, please consider contributing to the parser [here](https://github.com/euvl/vue-js-modal/blob/master/src/utils/parser.js).

`height: String | Number` `default: 300`

Height in pixels or percents (50, "50px", "50%") or `"auto"`.                       
 
Supported string values are `<number>%`, `<number>px` and `auto`. Setting height to `"auto"` makes it automatically change the height when the content size changes (this works well with `scrollable` feature).

---

`minWidth: Number (pixels)` `default: 0`

The minimum width to which modal can be resized.

---

`minHeight: Number (pixels)` `default: 0`

The minimum height to which modal can be resized.

---

`maxWidth: Number (pixels)` `default: Infinity`

The maximum width of the modal (if the value is greater than window width, window width will be used instead.

---

`maxHeight: Number (pixels)` `default: Infinity`

The maximum height of the modal (if the value is greater than window height, window height will be used instead.

---

`shiftX: Number (between 0 and 1.0)` `default: 0.5`

Horizontal position in `%`, default is `0.5` (meaning that modal box will be in the middle (50% from left) of the window

---

`shiftY: Number (between 0 and 1.0)` `default: 0.5`

Vertical position in `%`, default is `0.5` (meaning that modal box will be in the middle (50% from top) of the window.
